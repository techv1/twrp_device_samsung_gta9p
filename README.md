# TWRP Recovery for Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ 5G X216B

The Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ (codename **gta9pwifi**) is an 11.0″ mid-range tablet released in October 2023. This repository contains the device configuration files for building TWRP recovery.

> [!WARNING]
> **Display Panel Compatibility Issue**
> TWRP does not currently support devices equipped with **Himax** or **Chipone** display panels.
> * **The Symptom:** Recovery will boot, but touch input will not work.
> * **The Fix:** If you encounter this, force restart using hardware keys. If the device bootloops into TWRP, flash the stock `recovery.img` via Odin or Heimdall. This will not wipe your data.

## Build Instructions

### 1. Initialize Source

To get started with the Minimal TWRP manifest, you'll need to initialize to local repository:

```bash
repo init -u https://github.com/minimal-manifest-twrp/platform_manifest_twrp_aosp.git -b twrp-12.1

```

### 2. Sync Repository

Sync the TWRP source:

```bash
repo sync -j$(nproc)

```

### 3. Clone Device Tree

Clone the repo into your source tree:

```bash
git clone -b android-12.1 https://github.com/gta9pwifi-dev/twrp_device_samsung_gta9pwifi device/samsung/gta9pwifi

```

### 4. Build

Start the build. The `vendorsetup.sh` script will automatically handle the `lunch` command for the target:

```bash
. build/envsetup.sh
mka recoveryimage

```

## Troubleshooting & Recovery

If you find yourself in TWRP with **no touch functionality**, do not panic. Your data is safe. Follow these steps to restore your device to a working state.

### 1. Escape the Recovery Loop

If the device keeps booting back into the non-functional TWRP:

1. Perform a **Hard Restart**: Press and hold **Power + Volume Down** for about 7–10 seconds.
2. As soon as the screen goes black, let go. If it tries to boot TWRP again, you will need to manually enter **Download Mode** to flash the stock recovery.

### 2. Restoring Stock Recovery

You will need the stock `recovery.img` from your specific firmware version.

#### Option A: Using Odin

1. Boot the tablet into **Download Mode**.
2. Open Odin on your PC.
3. Pack your stock `recovery.img` into a `.tar` archive (using 7-Zip or similar).
4. Place the `.tar` file in the **AP** slot.
5. Click **Start**. The device will flash the stock recovery and reboot into Android.

#### Option B: Using Heimdall on Linux

1. Boot into **Download Mode**.
2. Connect to your PC and:

```bash
heimdall flash --RECOVERY recovery.img

```


3. The device will reboot automatically once the flash is complete

> [!NOTE]
> Flashing the stock recovery will **not** trigger a factory reset or delete your apps and photos. It replaces the recovery partition

If you want to help yourself, you can grab your touch panel ID using ADB while in TWRP (even if touch doesn't work, ADB usually does):

```bash
adb shell dmesg | grep -i "touch"

```
